# climate-action-project
This is a project that I created for IOELL Virtual 2023 which was conducted by GEIST International Foundation. Here, I used the Turtle module from Python, which was the first ever module that was learned by me, and that was 4 years ago! Since then, I haven't practiced too much, but I thought, why not get your hands dusted?
